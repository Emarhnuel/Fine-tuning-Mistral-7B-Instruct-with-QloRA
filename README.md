This project finetunes the Mistral-7B-Instruct model (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) on the Alpaca GPT-4 dataset to generate clear and concise instructions from descriptive contexts.

**Key Techniques**

* Finetuning: LoRA (with QLoRA optimizations) for efficient parameter updates.
* Quantization: BitsAndBytes for smaller model size and faster inference.
* Dataset: c-s-ale/alpaca-gpt4-data (Hugging Face Datasets)
  
Steps

Install Libraries:

Bash
pip install -qU bitsandbytes datasets accelerate loralib transformers peft trl
Use code with caution.
Load and Prepare Dataset: Load the Alpaca GPT-4 dataset and format it for instruction generation tasks.

Finetune the Model:  Using Lora and QLoRA, adapt Mistral-7B-Instruct to generate instructions.

Generate Instructions:  Feed the finetuned model a context and use the generate function to produce a new instruction.
